Events for this subcategory include: • 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. • 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. • 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. • 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. • 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. • 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. • 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. • 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem. • 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.  • 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. • 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces.

Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly.

            "Description": "This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a local user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).",
            "Rationale": "Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.",
            "Impact": "Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Warning: Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts: The out-of-box experience (OOBE) or user desktop auto logon can fail when a device reboots during the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP). This failure can occur when certain DeviceLock policies are applied to a device. If Windows Autopilot is used in the environment, assign this setting exclusively to user groups rather than device groups.

            "Description": "This security setting determines the period of time (in days) that a password must be used before the user can change it. You can set a value between 1 and 998 days, or you can allow changes immediately by setting the number of days to 0. The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s)).",
            "Rationale": "Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.",
            "Impact": "If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the password until the next day. Warning: If an organization is using Windows Hello for Business, the the Device Lock password settings can impact PIN polices if those policies are not first defined elsewhere. Windows will follow the Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs if this key exists: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Policies\\PassportForWork\\<Tenant- ID>\\Device\\Policies. Otherwise, it will follow Device Lock policies. This benchmark recommends configuring Device Lock policies for Local User accounts and Windows Hello for Business policies for PINs.",
